# Phishing Website Feature Definitions

# Overview
This project focuses on identifying phishing websites using logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM). The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for analysis and visualization. Logistic regression and SVM models are trained, and their performances are evaluated using various metrics.

# Setup
Environment Setup:

Ensure you have Python installed.
Install required libraries.
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Missing Values:
Check for missing values in the dataset.
 
Data Visualization:

Visualize data using charts, heatmap, and pair plots.
Heatmap.

Use a heatmap to visualize correlations between features.

# Model Training
Data Splitting:

Split the data into training and testing sets.

# logistic Regression:

Create and train the logistic regression model.

Model Evaluation:

Get predicted probabilities, calculate AUC, and visualize the ROC curve.

Accuracy Calculation:

Calculate accuracy.
Confusion Matrix:

Visualize confusion matrix using a seaborn heatmap.

# SVM (Support Vector Machine):

Standardize feature values and create an SVM classifier.
ROC Curve for SVM:

Compute ROC curve and AUC, and plot the ROC curve.
Confusion Matrix for SVM:

Calculate confusion matrix for the testing set and visualize using a heatmap.


# Accuracy of logistic regression
Accuracy: 0.90

# Accuracy of SVM
